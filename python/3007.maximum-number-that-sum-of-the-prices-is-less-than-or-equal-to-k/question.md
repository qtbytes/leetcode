# [3007. Maximum Number That Sum of the Prices Is Less Than or Equal to K][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-number-that-sum-of-the-prices-is-less-than-or-equal-to-k/

You are given an integer `k` and an integer `x`. The price of a number `num` is calculated by the
count of set bits at positions `x`, `2x`, `3x`, etc., in its binary representation, starting from
the least significant bit. The following table contains examples of how price is calculated.

| x | num | Binary Representation | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 13 | 00000 **1** **1** 0 **1** | 3 |
| 2 | 13 | 00000 **1** 101 | 1 |
| 2 | 233 | 0 **1** 1 **1** 0 **1** 001 | 3 |
| 3 | 13 | 000001 **1** 01 | 1 |
| 3 | 362 | **1** 01 **1** 01010 | 2 |

The **accumulated price** of `num` is the **total** price of numbers from `1` to `num`. `num` is
considered **cheap** if its accumulated price is less than or equal to `k`.

Return the **greatest** cheap number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 9, x = 1

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

As shown in the table below, `6` is the greatest cheap number.

| x | num | Binary Representation | Price | Accumulated Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 00 **1** | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 0 **1** 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 | 0 **1** **1** | 2 | 4 |
| 1 | 4 | **1** 00 | 1 | 5 |
| 1 | 5 | **1** 0 **1** | 2 | 7 |
| 1 | 6 | **1** **1** 0 | 2 | 9 |
| 1 | 7 | **1** **1** **1** | 3 | 12 |

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 7, x = 2

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

As shown in the table below, `9` is the greatest cheap number.

| x | num | Binary Representation | Price | Accumulated Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 1 | 0001 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 2 | 00 **1** 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 | 00 **1** 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 | 0100 | 0 | 2 |
| 2 | 5 | 0101 | 0 | 2 |
| 2 | 6 | 01 **1** 0 | 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 7 | 01 **1** 1 | 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 8 | **1** 000 | 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 9 | **1** 001 | 1 | 6 |
| 2 | 10 | **1** 0 **1** 0 | 2 | 8 |

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 10¹⁵`
- `1 <= x <= 8`
