# [572. Subtree of Another Tree][link] (Easy)

[link]: https://leetcode.cn/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of
`root` with the same structure and node values of ` subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's
descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
- The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-10⁴ <= root.val <= 10⁴`
- `-10⁴ <= subRoot.val <= 10⁴`
