# [3555. Smallest Subarray to Sort in Every Sliding Window][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subarray-to-sort-in-every-sliding-window/

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

For each contiguous subarray of length `k`, determine the **minimum** length of a continuous segment
that must be sorted so that the entire window becomes **non‑decreasing**; if the window is already
sorted, its required length is zero.

Return an array of length `n − k + 1` where each element corresponds to the answer for its window.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,2,4,5\], k = 3

**Output:**\[2,2,0\]

**Explanation:**

- `nums[0...2] = [1, 3, 2]`. Sort `[3, 2]` to get `[1, 2, 3]`, the answer is 2.
- `nums[1...3] = [3, 2, 4]`. Sort `[3, 2]` to get `[2, 3, 4]`, the answer is 2.
- `nums[2...4] = [2, 4, 5]` is already sorted, so the answer is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,4,3,2,1\], k = 4

**Output:**\[4,4\]

**Explanation:**

- `nums[0...3] = [5, 4, 3, 2]`. The whole subarray must be sorted, so the answer is 4.
- `nums[1...4] = [4, 3, 2, 1]`. The whole subarray must be sorted, so the answer is 4.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁶`
