# [3779. Minimum Number of Operations to Have Distinct Elements][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-172/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-have-distinct-elements/

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one operation, you remove the **first three elements** of the current array. If there are fewer
than three elements remaining, **all** remaining elements are removed.

Repeat this operation until the array is empty or contains no duplicate values.

Return an integer denoting the number of operations required.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,8,3,6,5,8\]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

In the first operation, we remove the first three elements. The remaining elements `[6, 5, 8]` are
all distinct, so we stop. Only one operation is needed.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2\]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

After one operation, the array becomes empty, which meets the stopping condition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,3,5,1,2\]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

All elements in the array are distinct, therefore no operations are needed.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁵`
