# [3782. Last Remaining Integer After Alternating Deletion Operations][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-172/problems/last-remaining-integer-after-alternating-deletion-operations/

You are given an integer `n`.

We write the integers from 1 to `n` in a sequence from left to right. Then, **alternately** apply
the following two operations until only one integer remains, starting with operation 1:

- **Operation 1**: Starting from the left, delete every second number.
- **Operation 2**: Starting from the right, delete every second number.

Return the last remaining integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 8

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Write `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` in a sequence.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The remaining
integers are `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
- Starting from the right, we delete every second number: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`. The remaining integers are
`[3, 7]`.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[3, 7]`. The remaining integer is `[3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- Write `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` in a sequence.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The remaining integers
are `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Starting from the right, we delete every second number: `[1, 3, 5]`. The remaining integers are
`[1, 5]`.
- Starting from the left, we delete every second number: `[1, 5]`. The remaining integer is `[1]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- Write `[1]` in a sequence.
- The last remaining integer is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10¹⁵`
