# [3650. Minimum Cost Path with Edge Reversals][link] (Medium)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-path-with-edge-reversals/

You are given a directed, weighted graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`, and an array
`edges` where `edges[i] = [uᵢ, vᵢ, wᵢ]` represents a directed edge from node `uᵢ` to node `vᵢ` with
cost `wᵢ`.

Each node `uᵢ` has a switch that can be used **at most once**: when you arrive at `uᵢ` and have not
yet used its switch, you may activate it on one of its incoming edges `vᵢ → uᵢ` reverse that edge to
`uᵢ → vᵢ` and **immediately** traverse it.

The reversal is only valid for that single move, and using a reversed edge costs `2 * wᵢ`.

Return the **minimum** total cost to travel from node 0 to node `n - 1`. If it is not possible,
return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[0,1,3\],\[3,1,1\],\[2,3,4\],\[0,2,2\]\]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/05/07/e1drawio.png)**

- Use the path `0 → 1` (cost 3).
- At node 1 reverse the original edge `3 → 1` into `1 → 3` and traverse it at cost `2 * 1 = 2`.
- Total cost is `3 + 2 = 5`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[0,2,1\],\[2,1,1\],\[1,3,1\],\[2,3,3\]\]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- No reversal is needed. Take the path `0 → 2` (cost 1), then `2 → 1` (cost 1), then `1 → 3` (cost
1).
- Total cost is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10⁵`
- `edges[i] = [uᵢ, vᵢ, wᵢ]`
- `0 <= uᵢ, vᵢ <= n - 1`
- `1 <= wᵢ <= 1000`
